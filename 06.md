# What is a process? What are its different states?

## What is a Process?

- A process is a program in execution.

- It is an active entity that requires resources like CPU, memory, files, and I/O devices.

- Each process has a Process Control Block (PCB) that stores information such as process ID, state, program counter, registers, and allocated resources.

- Example: If notepad.exe is a program on disk, opening it creates a process in memory.

## Different Process States

- A process goes through a set of states during its execution:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **New** | Process is being created/initialized. |
| **Ready** | Process is loaded in main memory, waiting to be assigned to CPU. |
| **Running** | Process is currently being executed on CPU. |
| **Waiting (or Blocked)** | Process is waiting for some event (like I/O completion) before it can proceed. |
| **Terminated (or Exit)** | Process has finished execution and is removed from the system. |
| **Suspended (optional)** | Process is temporarily halted (by user or OS) and can be resumed later. |
