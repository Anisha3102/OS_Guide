What are System Calls?

A System Call is the interface between a user program and the operating system kernel.

They allow user applications to request services from the OS (like file handling, memory management, process control).

Since user programs run in user mode and cannot directly access hardware, system calls provide a safe way to switch to kernel mode.

## Types of System Calls & Examples
| Category             | Purpose                                | Examples (in Linux/Unix) |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Process Control       | Create/terminate processes, load/execute programs | fork(), exec(), exit(), wait() |
| File Management       | Create, delete, read, write, open files | open(), read(), write(), close() |
| Device Management     | Request/release I/O devices, control devices | ioctl(), read(), write() |
| Information Maintenance | Get/set system data (time, attributes) | getpid(), alarm(), sleep(), uname() |
| Communication         | Exchange information between processes | pipe(), shmget(), msgsnd(), recv() |

## One-Liner:

“A system call is the programmatic way a process requests a service from the OS kernel, e.g., file I/O (read(), write()), process control (fork()), memory management (mmap()), and IPC (pipe(), shmget()).”
