# What are the four necessary conditions for deadlock (Coffman conditions)?

| Condition            | Description                                                                 | Example                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Mutual Exclusion** | At least one resource must be held in a non-sharable mode (only one process can use it at a time). | A printer can only print for one process at a time. |
| **2. Hold and Wait**   | A process holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources that are currently held by other processes. | P1 holds a file and waits for a printer, while P2 holds the printer and waits for the file. |
| **3. No Preemption**   | Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a process; they can only be released voluntarily by the process holding them. | A process must finish printing before releasing the printer. |
| **4. Circular Wait**   | A closed chain of processes exists, where each process holds a resource that the next process in the chain needs. | P1 → waiting for R2 (held by P2), P2 → waiting for R3 (held by P3), P3 → waiting for R1 (held by P1). |
