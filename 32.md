# What are different file allocation methods (contiguous, linked, indexed)?

## File Allocation Methods

When a file is stored on disk, the OS must decide how to allocate disk blocks. Three common methods are:

### 1. Contiguous Allocation

Files are stored in consecutive blocks on disk.

Metadata stores starting block + length.

#### Advantages: Fast (direct access, minimal seeks).

#### Disadvantages: External fragmentation, difficult to extend file size.

#### Example: Old DVD/CD systems, early FAT file systems.

### 2. Linked Allocation

Each file is a linked list of disk blocks.

Each block stores data + pointer to the next block.

#### Advantages: No external fragmentation, easy file growth.

#### Disadvantages: Slow random access (must traverse links), pointer overhead.

#### Example: FAT (File Allocation Table) system.

### 3. Indexed Allocation

Each file has an index block containing pointers to all its disk blocks.

OS uses the index to directly access blocks.

#### Advantages: Fast direct/random access, avoids fragmentation.

#### Disadvantages: Index block overhead (extra storage needed).

#### Example: UNIX file systems (ext2/ext3).

|---------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Contiguous Allocation | Stores file in consecutive disk blocks   | Fast access, simple                     | External fragmentation, hard to grow file | Early FAT, CDs |
| Linked Allocation   | Each block points to the next             | No fragmentation, flexible size         | Slow random access, pointer overhead      | FAT (chained) |
| Indexed Allocation  | Uses index block with pointers to blocks  | Fast random access, efficient management| Index block overhead, limited size        | UNIX (ext2/3) |
