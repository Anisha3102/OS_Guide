# Explain producer-consumer problem.

### Producer-Consumer Problem (Bounded Buffer Problem)

The producer-consumer problem describes a situation where:

Producer generates data/items and puts them into a shared buffer.

Consumer takes data/items out of the buffer and uses them.

The buffer has a limited size (bounded buffer).

### Problems that can occur:

Race condition – if producer and consumer access buffer simultaneously.

Buffer overflow – if producer adds items when the buffer is full.

Buffer underflow – if consumer tries to remove items when the buffer is empty.

### Solution Using Synchronization (Semaphores)

We use three synchronization variables:

mutex (binary semaphore) → ensures mutual exclusion (only one accesses buffer at a time).

empty (counting semaphore) → counts empty slots in buffer.

full (counting semaphore) → counts filled slots in buffer.

### Pseudo-code
#### Producer:
```c do {
    // produce an item
    wait(empty);   // decrease empty count
    wait(mutex);   // enter critical section
    // add item to buffer
    signal(mutex); // exit critical section
    signal(full);  // increase full count
} while (true);
```
#### Consumer:
```c do {
    wait(full);    // decrease full count
    wait(mutex);   // enter critical section
    // remove item from buffer
    signal(mutex); // exit critical section
    signal(empty); // increase empty count
    // consume the item
} while (true);
```
### Real-World Example

Producer: Web server writing logs into a file.

Consumer: Log analyzer reading entries from the file.
