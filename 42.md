# What is memory-mapped I/O vs. programmed I/O?

| **Feature**           | **Memory-Mapped I/O (MMIO)**                                                                                              | **Programmed I/O (PIO)**                                                                                  |

| **Definition**        | I/O devices are treated as if they are part of the main memory. Each device register is assigned a unique memory address. | CPU communicates directly with I/O devices using special I/O instructions (not regular memory addresses). |
| **Address Space**     | Shares the same address space as main memory.                                                                             | Has a separate I/O address space.                                                                         |
| **Instructions Used** | Normal memory instructions (like `MOV`, `LOAD`, `STORE`) are used for data transfer.                                      | Special I/O instructions (like `IN`, `OUT` in x86) are used.                                              |
| **Speed**             | Faster — allows use of standard memory access methods and caching.                                                        | Slower — requires special I/O commands and polling by the CPU.                                            |
| **Complexity**        | Simpler programming model — no separate I/O space to handle.                                                              | More complex — needs separate handling for I/O instructions.                                              |
| **Example Use Case**  | Used in modern systems (like ARM, RISC-V) where peripherals are mapped into memory space.                                 | Used in older architectures (like x86) with distinct I/O ports.                                           |
