# What is mutex and how is it different from semaphore?

## What is a Mutex?

A mutex (mutual exclusion object) is a synchronization primitive used to protect shared resources from concurrent access.

Only one thread/process can lock (own) a mutex at a time.

When a thread locks the mutex, others trying to access the same resource must wait until the mutex is unlocked.

| Feature            | Mutex                                                                 | Semaphore                                                                 |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ownership          | Owned by the thread that locks it → only that thread can unlock it.   | No ownership → any thread can signal (release) the semaphore.             |
| Value              | Binary (0 or 1) → acts as a lock.                                     | Can be binary (0/1) or counting (>1).                                    |
| Purpose            | Ensures mutual exclusion to a single resource.                       | Controls access to single or multiple instances of a resource.            |
| Use Case           | One thread writing to a file.                                        | Multiple threads accessing limited DB connections.                        |
| Overhead           | Slightly higher (needs tracking of ownership).                       | Lighter, but requires careful handling to avoid issues like deadlock.     |
| Example (Analogy)  | A key to a room: only one person with the key can enter.             | Tickets for a bus: multiple tickets → multiple people can enter.          |
