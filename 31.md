# What is a file system?

A file system defines how data is stored in blocks and how files/folders are structured.

It provides a hierarchical structure (files inside directories).

Handles metadata (file name, size, permissions, timestamps).

Supports operations like create, read, write, delete, update.

Ensures access control & security (permissions, user rights).

## Examples of File Systems:

Windows: FAT32, NTFS, exFAT

Linux/Unix: ext3, ext4, XFS

MacOS: APFS, HFS+

Distributed: HDFS (Hadoop), GFS (Google File System)

## Analogy:

Think of a file system as a library catalog:

Books = Files

Bookshelves = Directories

Librarian = File system (keeps track of where everything is stored).
