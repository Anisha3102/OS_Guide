# What are types of operating systems (Batch, Time-sharing, Distributed, Real-time, etc.)?

| Type | Description | Example Use Case |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **1. Batch OS** | Executes jobs in batches without user interaction. Jobs are collected, grouped, and executed together. | Payroll processing, bank statements |
| **2. Time-Sharing OS (Multitasking OS)** | Multiple users can access the system at the same time. CPU time is divided into small slices (time quantum). | UNIX, Windows Server |
| **3. Distributed OS** | Manages a group of independent computers and makes them appear as a single system. Resources are shared across nodes. | LOCUS, Amoeba, Hadoop clusters |
| **4. Real-Time OS (RTOS)** | Responds to inputs/events within a strict time limit. Used where timely processing is critical. | Air traffic control, medical systems, robotics |
| **5. Multiprogramming OS** | Multiple programs are kept in memory and the CPU switches between them to increase utilization. | Early IBM mainframes |
| **6. Multiprocessing OS** | Supports multiple CPUs that work in parallel to execute processes faster. | Linux, Windows, UNIX servers |
| **7. Network OS** | Provides services to connect and manage computers over a network. Focused on file sharing, communication, and resource management. | Novell NetWare, Windows Server |
| **8. Mobile OS** | Designed for smartphones and tablets, optimized for touch and low power usage. | Android, iOS |
