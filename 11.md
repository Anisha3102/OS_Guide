# What are CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes?

| Feature               | CPU-bound Process                                                                 | I/O-bound Process                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | A process that spends most of its time performing computations (using the CPU).  | A process that spends most of its time waiting for I/O operations (disk, network, user input). |
| **Resource Usage**     | Heavily utilizes the CPU; minimal I/O requests.                                   | Heavily utilizes I/O devices; minimal CPU usage.                                   |
| **Execution Time**     | Longer bursts of CPU execution; short I/O waits.                                  | Short CPU bursts; long waiting times for I/O completion.                           |
| **Performance Limitation** | Limited by CPU speed.                                                        | Limited by I/O device speed.                                                       |
| **Examples**           | Scientific computations, video rendering, data encryption.                        | File transfer, database queries, printing, web requests.                           |
