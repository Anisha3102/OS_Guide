# What is the difference between process and program?

| Feature | Program | Process |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Definition** | A passive entity: set of instructions stored on disk (executable file). | An active entity: a program in execution. |
| **State** | Static (does not change while stored). | Dynamic (changes as it runs: created, waiting, running, terminated). |
| **Existence** | Exists permanently on disk until deleted. | Exists temporarily in memory (RAM) while running. |
| **Resource Usage** | Does not require CPU, memory, or I/O resources. | Requires CPU, memory, I/O devices, and files to execute. |
| **Uniqueness** | One program can be started many times. | Each running instance of a program is a separate process. |
| **Examples** | **chrome.exe** file on disk. | Opening Chrome â†’ multiple Chrome processes running in Task Manager. |
