# What is disk scheduling? Explain algorithms like FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK.

Disk Scheduling refers to the method an OS uses to decide the order in which disk I/O requests are serviced.

Goal: minimize seek time (movement of disk head) and improve throughput.

## Disk Scheduling Algorithms
| Algorithm | Working | Pros | Cons | Example Use Case |
|-----------|---------|------|------|------------------|
| **FCFS (First Come First Serve)** | Requests are served in the order they arrive. | Fair, simple to implement. | Long average seek time (bad head movement). | Small systems with few requests. |
| **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)** | Selects the request closest to current head position. | Reduces seek time compared to FCFS. | May cause starvation of far-away requests. | General-purpose systems with moderate load. |
| **SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)** | Head moves in one direction servicing requests, then reverses direction. | Better throughput, avoids starvation. | Longer wait for requests just behind the head. | Disk drives, printers (like elevator). |
| **C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)** | Like SCAN, but head moves in one direction only. On reaching end, returns to start without servicing. | Provides uniform wait time. | Longer average seek time than SCAN. | Large multi-user systems. |
| **LOOK** | Similar to SCAN, but head only goes as far as last request in each direction (does not go to disk end). | Reduces unnecessary head movement. | Slightly more complex. | Efficient scheduling for busy systems. |
| **C-LOOK** | Like C-SCAN but head goes only as far as last request, then jumps back to start. | Reduces seek compared to C-SCAN. | Complex to implement. | Modern OS disk schedulers. |

## Quick One-Liners 

FCFS: Simple, fair but inefficient.

SSTF: Picks closest request → faster, but starvation possible.

SCAN: Elevator style → fairer, avoids starvation.

C-SCAN: Circular SCAN, uniform wait times.

LOOK/C-LOOK: Optimized versions (don’t go to disk ends unnecessarily).
