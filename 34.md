# What is RAID? Explain different RAID levels

RAID (Redundant Array of Independent/Inexpensive Disks) is a storage technology that combines multiple physical disks into a single logical unit for:

Performance improvement (faster reads/writes),

Fault tolerance (data safety if a disk fails),

Or both.

It uses techniques like mirroring, striping, and parity.

### Common RAID Levels
| RAID Level | Technique            | Description | Pros | Cons | Use Case |
|------------|----------------------|-------------|------|------|----------|
| RAID 0     | Striping             | Splits data across multiple disks. | High performance (fast read/write). | No redundancy → single disk failure = total data loss. | Gaming PCs, video editing (speed focus). |
| RAID 1     | Mirroring            | Duplicates (mirrors) data on 2+ disks. | High reliability, data survives disk failure. | Storage cost doubled, slower writes. | Critical data storage (finance, healthcare). |
| RAID 5     | Striping + Parity    | Data + parity distributed across disks. | Good balance: performance + redundancy, can survive 1 disk failure. | Write performance slower (parity calc). | Servers, databases. |
| RAID 6     | Striping + Double Parity | Similar to RAID 5 but with 2 parity blocks. | Can survive 2 simultaneous disk failures. | Slower writes, needs more storage. | Enterprise storage, high availability systems. |
| RAID 10 (1+0) | Mirroring + Striping | Stripes data across mirrored pairs. | High speed + fault tolerance. | Expensive (needs many disks). | High-performance databases, enterprise apps. |

### Quick Notes 

RAID 0 → Speed, no safety.

RAID 1 → Safety, no efficiency.

RAID 5 → Balance (speed + redundancy, 1 disk fault tolerance).

RAID 6 → Like RAID 5 but safer (2 disk fault tolerance).

RAID 10 → Best of RAID 0 + RAID 1 (fast + safe, but expensive).
