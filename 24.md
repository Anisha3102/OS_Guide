# Explain Banker’s Algorithm.

## Idea

Developed by Edsger Dijkstra.

Used for deadlock avoidance.

The OS works like a banker lending resources:

A customer (process) must declare its maximum claim in advance.

The banker (OS) only allocates resources if it can guarantee the system will remain in a safe state.

## Key Terms

Available → Vector of available resources of each type.

Max → Maximum demand of each process.

Allocation → Resources currently allocated to each process.

Need → Remaining resources needed = Max – Allocation.

Safe State → A state where there exists some sequence of processes such that each can finish with the currently available + resources from finished processes.

## Working of Banker’s Algorithm

When a process requests resources:

Check if request ≤ Need. If not, error.

Check if request ≤ Available. If not, wait.

Tentatively allocate resources (pretend to grant).

Run the Safety Algorithm:

See if the system can still reach a safe state.

If yes → grant request.

If no → roll back (process waits).

## Example

Suppose system has 3 resource types (A, B, C).

Available = [3, 3, 2]

Max matrix (maximum demand):

P1: [7, 5, 3]
P2: [3, 2, 2]
P3: [9, 0, 2]
P4: [2, 2, 2]
P5: [4, 3, 3]


#### Allocation matrix (currently allocated):

P1: [0, 1, 0]
P2: [2, 0, 0]
P3: [3, 0, 2]
P4: [2, 1, 1]
P5: [0, 0, 2]


Need = Max – Allocation.

The algorithm checks whether all processes can finish in some order → if yes, safe state.

## Advantages 

 Avoids deadlock by careful allocation.
 Always ensures safe state.

##  Disadvantages

 Requires processes to declare maximum need in advance.
 Overhead of running safety check for each request.
 Not suitable for dynamic, unpredictable systems.
