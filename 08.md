# Difference between process and thread.

| Feature | Process | Thread |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Definition** | A program in execution, the basic unit of resource allocation. | A lightweight process, the smallest unit of execution within a process. |
| **Resource Usage** | Has its own memory space (code, data, stack, heap). | Shares memory (code, data, heap) with other threads of the same process but has its own stack and registers. |
| **Creation Overhead** | More expensive (requires memory allocation, PCB creation). | Less expensive (created within a process, minimal resources needed). |
| **Communication** | Inter-process communication (IPC) needed (pipes, sockets, shared memory). | Easy, since threads share the same address space. |
| **Isolation** | Processes are isolated → one crash doesn’t affect others. | Threads are not isolated → one thread crash can crash the whole process. |
| **Context Switching** | Slower (involves switching memory space and PCB). | Faster (since threads share memory and resources). |
| **Examples** | Running Chrome browser, MS Word, or VLC media player. | Multiple tabs in Chrome, spell-check thread in MS Word, buffering thread in VLC. |
