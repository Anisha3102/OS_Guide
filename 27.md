# What is semaphore? Difference between binary semaphore and counting semaphore.

A semaphore is a synchronization primitive used to manage access to shared resources in concurrent programming. It uses a counter with two atomic operations:

- wait (P/down): Decrement the semaphore value; if it becomes negative, the process waits.

- signal (V/up): Increment the value; if it’s ≤ 0, a waiting process is resumed.

Semaphores help prevent race conditions and ensure process synchronization.

## Difference between Binary Semaphore and Counting Semaphore

| Feature       | Binary Semaphore                              | Counting Semaphore                                |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Value Range   | Only 0 or 1                                   | Any non-negative integer                         |
| Purpose       | Acts like a lock (mutex) – ensures mutual exclusion | Controls multiple instances of a resource        |
| Use Case      | Synchronizing access to a single resource     | Managing a pool of multiple resources            |
| Example       | Allowing only one thread to write to a file   | Allowing up to N threads to access a DB connection pool |
