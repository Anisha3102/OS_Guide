# What is the difference between internal fragmentation and external fragmentation?

| Feature             | Internal Fragmentation                                                                 | External Fragmentation                                                                 |

| **Definition**      | Wasted memory inside allocated blocks because the block is larger than the requested memory. | Wasted memory in the form of small gaps between allocated blocks that are too small to be used. |
| **Cause**           | Occurs when memory is allocated in fixed-size blocks (e.g., paging, partitioning).    | Occurs when memory is allocated in variable-sized blocks (e.g., segmentation, dynamic allocation). |
| **Location of Waste** | Inside a block.                                                                       | Between blocks.                                                                       |
| **Example**         | Process needs 18 KB but is allocated a 20 KB block → 2 KB wasted inside.              | Free memory: 10 KB + 5 KB + 15 KB scattered → a 25 KB process cannot fit, even though 30 KB is free. |
| **Solution**        | Reduce block size (but increases overhead).                                            | Compaction (rearranging processes), paging.                                           |
