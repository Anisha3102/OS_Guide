# What is the difference between kernel and shell?

| Feature | Kernel | Shell |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Definition** | The core part of the OS that directly interacts with hardware and manages system resources. | The interface between the user and OS that takes commands from the user and gives them to the kernel. |
| **Role** | Resource manager → handles CPU, memory, devices, file system. | Command interpreter → translates user commands into actions. |
| **Interaction** | Works at the low level, invisible to users. | Works at the high level, directly interacts with users. |
| **Mode of Operation** | Runs in kernel mode (privileged mode). | Runs in user mode. |
| **Examples** | Monolithic Kernel (Linux), Microkernel (Minix), Hybrid (Windows NT). | Bash, Zsh, Ksh, PowerShell, Command Prompt. |
| **Dependency** | OS cannot work without a kernel. | System can run without shell (e.g., embedded systems), but it won’t be user-friendly. |
