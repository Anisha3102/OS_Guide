# What is an interrupt? Difference between hardware and software interrupts.

## What is an Interrupt?

An interrupt is a signal sent to the CPU that temporarily halts the current execution and transfers control to a specific routine called the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) or Interrupt Handler.
It allows the CPU to respond immediately to important events, improving efficiency and responsiveness.

## Example:

When you press a key on the keyboard — a hardware interrupt tells the CPU to read the keystroke.

When a program divides a number by zero — a software interrupt (trap) is generated by the program itself.

## Difference Between Hardware and Software Interrupts
| **Feature** | **Hardware Interrupt** | **Software Interrupt** |
|--------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Definition** | Generated by external hardware devices to signal an event to the CPU. | Generated by programs or instructions within the CPU. |
| **Source** | External I/O devices (keyboard, mouse, disk, etc.). | Internal to the system (software or OS call). |
| **Trigger** | Triggered by hardware signals. | Triggered by executing a specific instruction (like INT in x86). |
| **Handling** | Handled by the hardware interrupt controller. | Handled by software routines or OS calls. |
| **Examples** | Keyboard input, mouse movement, disk I/O completion, timer tick. | Division by zero, invalid opcode, system calls (INT 80h in Linux). |
| **Speed** | Usually faster (real-time hardware events). | Slower (depends on software execution). |


## Tip:

An interrupt is like someone tapping your shoulder while you’re working — hardware interrupts come from outside (like a device), while software interrupts come from inside (like your own program needing attention).
