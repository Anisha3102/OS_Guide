# What is paging and segmentation?

# 1. Paging

## Definition: 
Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates external fragmentation by dividing both physical memory and logical memory into fixed-size blocks.

## Details:

Logical memory → divided into pages.

Physical memory → divided into frames.

The OS maintains a page table that maps pages → frames.

## Advantages:

No external fragmentation.

Easy memory allocation.

## Disadvantages:

Internal fragmentation possible (last page not fully used).

Page table overhead.

# 2. Segmentation

## Definition: Segmentation is a memory management scheme that divides memory into variable-sized segments, based on the logical structure of a program.

## Details:

Each program is divided into segments like code, data, stack, heap.

Each segment has a segment number and offset.

A segment table maps segments → physical addresses.

## Advantages:

Logical view of memory (supports modular programming).

No internal fragmentation.

## Disadvantages:

External fragmentation possible.

Complex memory management.
