# What are monitors in OS?

A monitor is like a wrapper around shared data, the procedures that operate on it, and the synchronization between them.

It ensures only one process/thread can be active inside the monitor at a time → providing mutual exclusion automatically.

Monitors typically use condition variables with operations:

wait() → process waits until a condition is true.

signal() → wakes up a waiting process.

##### Advantage: Easier to use than semaphores, because the compiler/OS takes care of synchronization.
##### Limitation: Works only in high-level languages that support monitor constructs (not at hardware level).
