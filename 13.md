# What are different CPU scheduling algorithms? (FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority, Multilevel Queue)

## 1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)

Type: Non-preemptive

How it works: Processes are scheduled in the order they arrive in the ready queue.

Pros: Simple, fair.

Cons: Can cause convoy effect (short process waits for long one).

Example: Queue at a printer.

## 2. Shortest Job First (SJF)

Type: Can be preemptive (Shortest Remaining Time First, SRTF) or non-preemptive.

How it works: Process with the smallest CPU burst is executed first.

Pros: Minimizes average waiting time (optimal).

Cons: Hard to predict next CPU burst; may cause starvation of long jobs.

## 3. Round Robin (RR)

Type: Preemptive

How it works: Each process gets a fixed time quantum. After quantum expires, it goes back to the ready queue.

Pros: Fair for all, good for time-sharing systems.

Cons: Performance depends heavily on time quantum size.

## 4. Priority Scheduling

Type: Can be preemptive or non-preemptive.

How it works: CPU assigned to the process with the highest priority.

Pros: Useful when processes have different importance levels.

Cons: Starvation of low-priority processes (solved by aging).

## 5. Multilevel Queue Scheduling

Type: Preemptive

How it works: Ready queue divided into multiple queues (e.g., system, interactive, batch). Each queue has its own scheduling algorithm.

Pros: Good for systems with different process types.

Cons: Rigid; once assigned to a queue, a process cannot move.

## Table (Summary)
| Algorithm              | Type             | How it Works | Pros | Cons | Example |
|------------------------|------------------|--------------|------|------|---------|
| **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** | Non-preemptive | Runs in order of arrival | Simple, fair | Convoy effect (long jobs delay short ones) | Printer queue |
| **Shortest Job First (SJF)** | Preemptive/Non-preemptive | Picks job with smallest CPU burst | Optimal avg. waiting time | Hard to predict burst, starvation possible | Batch jobs |
| **Round Robin (RR)** | Preemptive | Fixed time quantum per process | Fair, good for time-sharing | Depends on quantum size | Time-sharing OS |
| **Priority Scheduling** | Preemptive/Non-preemptive | Highest priority first | Handles critical tasks well | Starvation of low priority (solved by aging) | Real-time systems |
| **Multilevel Queue** | Preemptive | Processes separated into multiple queues with different scheduling | Handles different process types | Inflexible (no movement between queues) | System + User processes |
