# What are user-level threads and kernel-level threads?

| Feature      | User-Level Threads (ULT) | Kernel-Level Threads (KLT) |
|--------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Definition** | Threads managed by a user-level thread library, without kernel involvement. | Threads managed directly by the OS kernel. |
| **Management** | Entirely handled in user space by a runtime library. | Managed in kernel space by the OS. |
| **Speed** | Faster to create and switch (since kernel is not involved). | Slower due to system call overhead for management. |
| **Portability** | More portable (not dependent on OS thread support). | Less portable (depends on OS implementation). |
| **Blocking** | If one thread makes a blocking system call, the whole process is blocked. | Only the calling thread is blocked, others continue execution. |
| **Concurrency** | Canâ€™t utilize multiple processors (since kernel sees only one process). | Can run truly in parallel on multiprocessor systems. |
| **Examples** | Java Green Threads, POSIX pthread library (user implementation). | Windows threads, Linux kernel threads. |
