# What is the difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling?

| Feature       | Preemptive Scheduling                                                       | Non-Preemptive Scheduling                                                |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition** | CPU can be taken away from a running process and assigned to another process. | Once a process starts execution, it cannot be stopped until it finishes or goes to waiting state. |
| **CPU Control** | The OS decides when to stop/resume a process.                             | The process keeps the CPU until it releases it voluntarily.               |
| **Response Time** | Better — short/urgent processes can get quick attention.                 | Worse — a long process may delay all others.                             |
| **Overhead**  | Higher (requires context switching).                                       | Lower (no forced switching).                                             |
| **Fairness**  | More fair, avoids starvation of short/priority tasks.                      | Less fair — may cause convoy effect (one long job delays others).        |
| **Examples**  | Round Robin, Preemptive Priority, SRTF.                                    | FCFS, Non-preemptive Priority, Non-preemptive SJF.                       |
