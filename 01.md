# What is an Operating System?

**An Operating System is a system software that manages hardware resources and provides services to application programs and users. It handles process management, memory management, file handling, device control, and system security, making the interaction between users and hardware simple and efficient.**

- It provides an environment in which users can execute programs conveniently and efficiently.

## Main Functions of OS

- Process Management → Creating, scheduling, and terminating processes.

- Memory Management → Allocating and deallocating memory, managing virtual memory.

- File System Management → Organizing, storing, and retrieving files on storage devices.

- Device Management → Controlling and coordinating input/output devices via drivers.

- Security & Protection → Preventing unauthorized access, managing permissions.

- User Interface → Providing CLI (Command Line Interface) or GUI (Graphical User Interface).

## Simple Analogy

- Think of the OS as a manager in a company:

- Users are like clients → They request services.

- Hardware is like employees → They perform tasks.

- OS (manager) ensures tasks are assigned properly, no conflicts, and resources are used efficiently.
