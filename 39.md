# What is swapping?

Swapping is a memory management technique where a process is temporarily moved from main memory (RAM) to secondary storage (disk), and brought back later for execution.

It allows the OS to free up RAM for other processes when memory is limited.

## How it Works

Process is in RAM → may be running or waiting.

If memory is needed for another process, the OS swaps out the process to disk (swap space/page file).

When the process is scheduled again → it is swapped back into RAM.

## Advantages

Enables multiprogramming with limited physical memory.

Keeps CPU busy by allowing more processes in memory than physically possible.

## Disadvantages

Swapping introduces overhead (disk I/O is slower than RAM).

Frequent swapping → thrashing, reducing overall performance.

## One-liner

“Swapping is the process of temporarily moving processes between main memory and disk to manage memory efficiently and enable multiprogramming.”
