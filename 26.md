# What are critical sections?

A critical section is a part of a program where a process accesses shared resources, such as variables, files, or devices. Since multiple processes/threads may try to access these resources at the same time, the critical section must be executed by only one process at a time to avoid race conditions.

A correct solution to the critical section problem must satisfy:

Mutual Exclusion – Only one process can be in the critical section at once.

Progress – If no process is inside, one waiting must be allowed to enter.

Bounded Waiting – No process should wait indefinitely.

## Example: Updating a shared counter or writing to a file.
