# What is virtual memory?


## Definition

Virtual memory is a memory management technique where the operating system gives an illusion of having more main memory (RAM) than physically available by using a portion of the secondary storage (disk).

It allows large programs to run even if physical RAM is small.

## How it Works

Virtual memory uses paging or segmentation to divide memory into fixed-size blocks.

When RAM is full, inactive memory pages are swapped out to disk (swap space).

When needed again, they are brought back into RAM (page-in).

The MMU (Memory Management Unit) handles mapping between virtual addresses (used by programs) and physical addresses (actual RAM).

## Advantages

Run programs larger than physical memory.

Provides isolation and protection (each process has its own virtual address space).

Efficient use of RAM.

Simplifies programming (developers don’t worry about physical memory size).

## Disadvantages

Disk access is much slower than RAM → may cause thrashing if too many pages are swapped.

Overhead in address translation.
