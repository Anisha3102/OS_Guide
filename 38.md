# What is demand paging?

Demand Paging is a lazy loading technique in virtual memory systems.

Instead of loading the entire process into memory at once, only the required pages are loaded when they are actually needed.

If a page is not in memory when a process tries to access it → a page fault occurs, and the OS brings that page from disk to RAM.

## How it Works

Process starts execution → only minimal pages (like first instruction) are loaded.

If process references a page not in RAM → Page Fault.

## OS checks:

If reference is valid (legal address).

If valid → bring page from disk (secondary storage) into RAM.

If memory is full → use a page replacement algorithm (e.g., FIFO, LRU).

Restart the instruction that caused the fault.

## Advantages

Saves memory (only required pages are loaded).

Faster process startup (don’t wait to load entire program).

Enables larger programs to run than physical memory.

## Disadvantages

Page faults cause high overhead (disk access is very slow).

Too many page faults → Thrashing (system spends more time swapping than executing).

## One-liner:
“Demand Paging is a virtual memory management technique where pages are loaded into RAM only when they are required, instead of preloading the whole process. It improves memory utilization but may cause page faults.”
