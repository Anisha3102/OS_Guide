# Difference between paging and segmentation.

| **Feature**             | **Paging**                                                     | **Segmentation**                                                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**          | Memory is divided into fixed-size blocks called **pages**.     | Memory is divided into variable-sized blocks called **segments**.      |
| **Size**                | All pages are of equal size.                                   | Segments are of different sizes, depending on the program’s structure. |
| **Basis of Division**   | Divides **physical memory**.                                   | Divides **logical memory** (based on functions, data, code, etc.).     |
| **Address Translation** | Uses **page number + offset**.                                 | Uses **segment number + offset**.                                      |
| **Fragmentation Type**  | Causes **internal fragmentation** (unused space inside pages). | Causes **external fragmentation** (free gaps between segments).        |
| **User View**           | Invisible to user — purely a **hardware technique**.           | Visible to user — logical units like **functions, arrays, etc.**       |
| **Example**             | Page size = 4 KB, process of 10 KB → needs 3 pages.            | Process has 3 segments: **code, data, stack.**                         |

##### Paging is for efficient memory management using fixed-size blocks, while segmentation reflects the logical structure of a program using variable-sized blocks
