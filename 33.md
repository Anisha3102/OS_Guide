| Feature                | FAT (File Allocation Table)                   | NTFS (New Technology File System)               |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Full Form              | File Allocation Table                         | New Technology File System                      |
| Introduced By          | Microsoft (1977, used in DOS & early Windows) | Microsoft (1993, Windows NT and later)          |
| Structure              | Uses a simple table to map files to clusters  | Uses Master File Table (MFT) with metadata      |
| File Size Limit        | FAT32 → 4 GB max per file                     | Supports very large files (16 TB+)              |
| Partition Size Limit   | FAT32 → up to 2 TB                            | Supports very large partitions (16 TB+)         |
| Security               | No built-in permissions or encryption         | Supports file-level security, ACLs, encryption  |
| Reliability            | More prone to corruption, no journaling       | Journaling supported (logs changes for recovery)|
| Performance            | Simple, works well on small disks/USBs        | Optimized for large disks, better performance   |
| Compatibility          | Universally supported (USBs, cameras, etc.)   | Mostly Windows (limited support in Linux/macOS) |
| Best Use Case          | Removable drives, memory cards                | Internal hard drives, SSDs, enterprise storage  |
