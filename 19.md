# What is page replacement? Explain algorithms like FIFO, LRU, Optimal.

## What is Page Replacement?

In virtual memory, processes may need more pages than can fit in physical memory (RAM).

When a page not currently in RAM is accessed → Page Fault occurs.

If RAM is full, the OS must replace one of the existing pages with the new one.

Page Replacement Algorithms decide which page to remove.

## Example:

Suppose we have 3 page frames and reference string:
7, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4

FIFO: Replace oldest page.

LRU: Replace least recently used page.

Optimal: Replace page that won’t be used for the longest future time.

| Algorithm | Description | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|-------------|------|------|
| **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** | Replace the oldest loaded page (the one brought earliest into memory). | Simple, easy to implement using a queue. | May replace frequently used pages → **Belady’s anomaly** (more frames → more faults). |
| **LRU (Least Recently Used)** | Replace the page that has not been used for the longest time. | Good approximation of actual usage → performs better than FIFO. | Needs extra hardware (counters or stack) → higher overhead. |
| **Optimal (OPT / MIN)** | Replace the page that will not be used for the longest time in the future. | Theoretically best (minimum page faults). | Not possible in practice (future knowledge needed), used as a benchmark. |
