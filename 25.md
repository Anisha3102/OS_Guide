# What is process synchronization?

## Definition

Process Synchronization is the mechanism that ensures that multiple processes or threads can execute concurrently without interfering with each other, especially when they share resources (CPU, memory, files, I/O devices).

Goal: Maintain data consistency and avoid race conditions.

## Why is it needed?

Concurrent Execution → Multiple processes/threads run at the same time.

Shared Resources → If two processes access shared data simultaneously, results may be inconsistent.

Race Condition → When the outcome depends on the sequence/timing of processes.

## Example:
Two threads updating a shared counter.

If not synchronized → final value may be wrong.

If synchronized → correct result guaranteed.

## Critical Section Problem

A critical section is the part of code where a process accesses shared resources.

#### Synchronization ensures:

Mutual Exclusion → Only one process in the critical section at a time.

Progress → If no process is in the critical section, one waiting should get a chance.

Bounded Waiting → No process should wait forever to enter.
