# Difference between monolithic kernel and microkernel.

| Feature              | Monolithic Kernel                                          | Microkernel                                          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Definition            | Entire OS (file system, device drivers, memory mgmt, etc.) runs in kernel mode. | Only minimal services (IPC, scheduling, memory mgmt) run in kernel; rest run in user space. |
| Size                 | Large and complex.                                         | Small and simple.                                   |
| Performance          | Faster (no context switch for system services).            | Slower (more user ↔ kernel mode switches).          |
| Reliability          | Less reliable → a bug in one service can crash the whole system. | More reliable → failure in user-level service doesn’t crash kernel. |
| Extensibility        | Harder to extend and maintain.                             | Easier to extend (add services in user space).      |
| Communication        | Uses system calls directly.                                | Relies on **message passing / IPC**.                |
| Examples             | Linux, UNIX, Windows (Hybrid but closer to monolithic).    | Minix, QNX, macOS (partially microkernel, Mach).    |

##  One-Liner:
Monolithic Kernel = Big + fast, but less reliable.

Microkernel = Small + modular, more secure, but slower due to IPC overhead.
