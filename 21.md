# What is a deadlock?

## Definition:
A deadlock is a situation in an operating system where two or more processes are waiting indefinitely for resources that are held by each other, so none of them can proceed.

It’s like two people crossing a narrow bridge and both refusing to step back — result: no one moves.

## Conditions for Deadlock (Coffman’s Conditions)

##### Deadlock can occur if all 4 conditions hold simultaneously:

Mutual Exclusion → At least one resource is non-sharable (only one process can use it at a time).

Hold and Wait → A process holding resources is waiting for more resources.

No Preemption → Resources cannot be forcibly taken away; they must be released voluntarily.

Circular Wait → A cycle exists where each process waits for a resource held by the next process in the chain.

(If any one of these conditions is broken, deadlock cannot occur.)

## Example

Process P1 holds Resource A and waits for Resource B.

Process P2 holds Resource B and waits for Resource A.
- Both are waiting forever → Deadlock.

## Deadlock Handling Methods

Prevention → Ensure at least one Coffman condition never holds (e.g., no circular wait).

Avoidance → Use algorithms like Banker’s Algorithm to avoid unsafe states.

Detection and Recovery → Let deadlock happen, detect it (using wait-for graphs), then recover (abort or preempt processes).

Ignore → Some OS (like Windows, Linux) just ignore deadlocks, assuming they’re rare.
