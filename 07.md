# What is PCB (Process Control Block)?

- The Process Control Block (PCB) is a data structure maintained by the operating system for every process.

- It contains all the information about a specific process that is needed for process management.

- The PCB acts like the identity card of a process â†’ whenever a process is paused and later resumed, the OS uses the PCB to restore its state.
