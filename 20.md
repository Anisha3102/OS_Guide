# What is thrashing?

## Definition:
- Thrashing occurs when a process spends more time swapping pages in and out of memory (page faults) than actually executing instructions.

- It happens when the degree of multiprogramming is too high (too many processes in memory at once), and each process does not have enough frames to execute properly.

## Causes of Thrashing

High degree of multiprogramming → Too many processes in RAM.

Insufficient physical memory → Not enough frames to hold active pages.

Poor page replacement policy → Frequently replaces needed pages.

## Effects of Thrashing

CPU utilization drops sharply (CPU waits for I/O).

System throughput decreases.

More page faults per second (PPS).

The system becomes unresponsive.

## Solutions to Thrashing

Working Set Model → Give each process enough frames for its working set (the set of actively used pages).

Page Fault Frequency (PFF) → Monitor fault rate and adjust the number of frames dynamically.

Reduce degree of multiprogramming → Suspend or swap out some processes.

Increase physical memory (if possible).
