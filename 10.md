# What is context switching?

## Definition:
Context switching is the process of saving the state of a currently running process/thread and restoring the state of another process/thread, so that CPU can switch execution from one to another.

- It allows multiprogramming and multitasking by giving the illusion that multiple processes are running simultaneously.

## Steps in Context Switching

Save state of the current process (in PCB â€“ registers, program counter, stack pointer, etc.).

Update PCB of the process with its saved state.

Choose the next process to run (based on scheduling policy).

Load the saved state of the new process from its PCB.

Resume execution of the new process from where it left off.

## When Context Switching Occurs?

CPU scheduling (time slice expires in time-sharing systems).

Higher priority process becomes ready.

I/O interrupts or system calls.

Process termination.

## Overhead of Context Switching

No useful work is done during switching (only saving/restoring state).

Frequent context switches increase CPU overhead.
