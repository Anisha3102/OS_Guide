# Difference between multitasking, multithreading, and multiprocessing.

| Feature            | Multitasking                                                                 | Multithreading                                                                 | Multiprocessing                                                                 |

| **Definition**      | Running multiple tasks/programs seemingly at the same time.                  | Running multiple threads of a single process concurrently.                      | Running multiple processes simultaneously on multiple CPUs/cores.               |
| **Unit of Work**    | Task/Process                                                                 | Thread (smaller unit within a process)                                         | Independent process                                                             |
| **Resource Usage**  | Each task gets CPU time via scheduling.                                       | Threads share same memory & resources of the process.                          | Each process has its own memory & resources.                                    |
| **Isolation**       | Processes are isolated.                                                      | Threads are not isolated â†’ error in one thread may affect the process.          | Processes are isolated from each other.                                         |
| **Concurrency/Parallelism** | Concurrency via context switching.                                   | Concurrency within a single process (faster context switch).                   | True parallelism (different CPUs/cores execute simultaneously).                 |
| **Examples**        | Playing music + editing a document + downloading a file.                     | Web browser tabs, MS Word spell-check + autosave threads.                      | Scientific computations on multi-core CPUs, database servers.                   |
