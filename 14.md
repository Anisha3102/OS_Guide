# What is starvation and aging in scheduling?

## Starvation in Scheduling

Definition: Starvation (or indefinite blocking) occurs when a process waits indefinitely in the ready queue because higher priority processes keep getting CPU time.

Cause: Usually happens in Priority Scheduling or SJF, where lower-priority or long jobs are always postponed.

Example: In a printer queue, if small/urgent jobs keep coming, a large batch print job may never get executed.

## Aging in Scheduling

Definition: Aging is a technique to prevent starvation by gradually increasing the priority of processes that wait in the system for a long time.

How it works: Over time, the OS increases the priority of waiting processes, ensuring they eventually get CPU time.

Example: In Priority Scheduling, a low-priority process waiting for 10 minutes may have its priority boosted so it eventually gets scheduled.
